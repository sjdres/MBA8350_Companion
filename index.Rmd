## About this book... {-}

This course companion is a collection of lecture notes I have compiled over my years of teaching *Analyzing and Leveraging Data* (MBA 8350). I have custom made this material to ensure that all of the relevant topics of the course is included within these pages so we **DO NOT** need an additional textbook.

The purpose of this course companion is to accomplish three goals.

1. Introduce you to the foundational theory and application of statistical methods

2. Introduce you to a cutting-edge software language for statistical computing and data visualization (R)

3. Do away with the need for a formal textbook

While there are certain chapters devoted solely to the second goal, new tricks on how to use R will be scattered throughout the chapters whenever we apply a new statistical method. By the end of the course, we will be not only have a clear understanding of statistical methods but have the working knowledge of an extremely powerful software language with which to apply it! 

## Acknowledgements {-}

This course companion would not be possible without the many students I have had the pleasure of teaching statistics to at VSB. Their questions, comments, and corrections to previous editions of these notes have made a significant contribution to what this product is. I am not going to call this a *final* product, because I hope my current and future students will continue to help me improve this.

This course companion was also made possible thanks to a Villanova School of Business 2021 Teaching Innovation Grant.
